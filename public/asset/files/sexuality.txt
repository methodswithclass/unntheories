Being progressive is a funny thing. People think it's this absolute. But it turns out to be rather relative. The world is a funny place. People think it's restrictive, and based on rules, but it actually turns out to be rather arbitrary, abstract, ever evolving, morphing, changing, adapting, and shifting to meet this funny little thing called "balance."

So, the topic of sex comes to my mind recently. Sexuality to be more specific. I've obviously been noticing the changes taking place in certain communities and even the mainstream with regard to sex and gender identification. The way it's becoming more abstract and less tied to a person's genitalia. We're barely scratching the surface, now, even at the bleeding edges of this movement, and there is still a ton of resistance to it in the mainstream, especially from that oh so loving institution called "religion." Or whatever. 

But this piece is not going to be all be roses and posies for the LGBTQ community, in fact, it will probably read more like an indictment. Hopefully a challenge.

.

People think they're progressive, but I don't think people are nearly progressive enough. Especially within the circles where this stuff is apparently happening. We are making huge strides in understanding the separation between a person's genitalia and their gender, but barely. We are beginning to understand better what compatibility between people in relationships means but it's not explicit yet. 

Topics like biological sex, gender, power dynamics, BDSM, and personality types are all linked, but in my mind, they are all ultimately independent from one another, and unfortunately, I think, vastly misunderstood. For instance, when you read 'BDSM', you probably immediately imagined whips and chains in a professional or amateur's dominatrix dungeon. Or the literal paraphernalia involved in a couple’s casual or serious kink fetish. But BDSM has little to do with that. In fact, you, in a typical institutional, traditional, sacred, and cherished Christian vanilla marriage, or even one not so traditional, maybe homosexual or explicitly kinky in some way, or maybe even involving other people, practice BDSM every single day of your waking life. 

Either you or your partner "wears the pants," so to speak, at some point in the day, of your basic daily lives, either sexually or not, and one of you must do it, are required to do it, at every given moment of the continued existence of the relationship, or it breaks down, and you break up. If it's healthy, and not abusive, you probably switch depending on the situation, time of day, event, meal, or mood.

What I'm talking about is power. And it's completely independent of gender and especially genitalia. 

.

In the history of the world, people have been historically plain stupid. It doesn't take long to figure that out. That's just the right word, by the way. I'm not trying to be insulting or condescending. Just to be clear, yes, I mean--you, dear reader. You are, in fact--stupid. Deal with it. I, the writer of this amazing blog--am pretty stupid. I know it. So, it's not surprising when you realize that the first thing people do to figure each other out is to use the strongest sense we have: sight. You essentially can literally see people's genitalia hanging out of their clothing. It's sort of ridiculous. Imagine that clothing actually did its job and hid our genitalia entirely so that you literally couldn't tell the difference between a man or a woman who you saw on the street just by looking at them. How difficult would it be to interact with people in the society we operate in today? I have a guess.

At this point in history. (Yes, it's just an arbitrary point. Sorry to burst your bubble.) We're just beginning to learn the truth that gender and genitalia MIGHT not align. Wow, what a revelation. "Holy crap, what?" For the first ten thousand years of recorded history (and maybe, but no one will ever know for sure, the hundred and ninety thousand, or so, years before that, with genetically human people on the planet), we have thought two things. One, that people with penises were "men" and that people with vaginas were "women," and two, that "men" should be in control, and "women" should be subservient. There are a lot of bad arguments made in favor of these view points, and there are a lot of good arguments just now being made about the first hundred and ninety thousand years (that's a long damn time; say it with me "one hundred and ninety t-h-o-u-s-a-n-d years") that would suggest those people didn't think the way we have in the last (only) t-e-n thousand years or so, but that work is very slow going and meets a lot of resistance.

For more on the theories about the switched power dynamic between men and women before the dawn of Agriculture, I would suggest picking up the excellent book by Cacilda Jethá and Christopher Ryan called "Sex at Dawn." 

It's a fantastic read for anyone. 

Especially if you're interested in feminism, evolution, anthropology, sexuality, life, or breathing. 

Especially if you're not a fascist. 

But if you're a fascist, please read it, don't burn it. 

Thanks. 

Either way, if you want to burn it, I suppose you'll have to pay for it first, so.... jokes on you. 

Fire!

Anyway, I digress. My point is that penises aren't all that big o' deal. Basically, what I'm saying is get over it. Your vagina doesn't mean anything. Your penis doesn't grant you rights. Your vagina is beautiful, but you still probably want to punch me in the face sometimes, or be aggressive, or play football, or not wear makeup. And that's totally fine. Stop wearing fucking makeup. Jesus. But you also want to have sex with a person with a penis. That's cool. Or you don't. That's cool too. It doesn't matter. It's independent, and arbitrary. You might do all those things, have sex with men, but then still do him favors and get him beer. It makes no effing sense, man. Your penis is cool and all, but you still probably want to wear capris, drop your wrist, flit your eyes, curse like a sailor, be aggressive, talk about hot women, but then have sex with men and women. And depending on who you're with (the person, not the gender, or the sex) you'll either be a top or a bottom. It really doesn't make any sense. It's not supposed to.

What I'm trying to say is that when people woke up on this planet sometime AFTER we became genetically human, but before the dawn of Agriculture, actually right about the same time (how do you spell 'coinkidink'?), we started using our big brains with its big "tools" to categorize things. And yeah, we went a little crazy. Or a lot crazy. And now literally everything has a name, category, classification, designation, serial number, ID, social security number, but no health insurance, no voter registration card, type, class, race, gender, sex, orientation, preference, relationship status, favorite food, and favorite slice of the goddamn visible (obviously) electromagnetic spectrum, motherfucker. What's your favorite X-Ray? Mine's 4.165286e18 Hz. 

For example, I literally just used 17 different classifying words to describe the exact same thing, in order to get my point across. I have that capability because our society in some ten thousand years (actually it took us about two thousand) years has essentially already completed the world, and we're bored, so we started just redefining things. Anyway, not the point. 

Relationships are about sex. Physical sex. Intercourse. Not making babies. Bonding. Sex is about power. Not abuse. Just power. You exercise power when you tell your spouse or partner that you love them. You exercise power when you ask for the paper on the counter, and they hand it to you. You just performed BDSM. In that moment, you were the Dom, they were the Sub. They did your bidding. You literally controlled their will. It's a willing exchange, consensual, and mutual. Because later you will get them a pen, or hand them a drink, or perform oral sex. Or literally bottom in intercourse. Then you might top, through any various means. Either naturally or not.

.

Relationships are breaking down. There's a current persistent phenomenon of "online dating" that usually destroys people's ability to find a match. People's attention spans have dropped to zero. No one is just living their lives. They have to live their "best life" or none at all... If they don't "feel" that it's a fit in the first instant, they simply walk away. No discussion, no understanding, no acceptance, they've (read: women) usually got 20 other potential matches waiting in their queue, willing to go out with them tomorrow. They might even already have a date lined up when they meet with you, just in case you are "weird" (read: human). I know I don't have that many matches, and I've seen the Tinder profiles of my women friends, there are sometimes hundreds. I'm not saying these women are actively pursuing or even contemplating going out or even talking to any of those people, but simply that they could, if they wanted to, have cheap contact, in an instant. All they have to do is make it happen. Some women are better at it than others, and it is a skill, but the potential to manipulate the generic penis is virtually unlimited. Let's not be coy here. The opposite is no longer, if it ever was, true. Absolutely not. And this doesn't necessarily apply to gay men. The dynamic in the gay community is completely different.

A bit of personal background, I just started seeing someone. It's in the early stages, but she's very different than anyone I've ever met, and to her, I think, I'm also very different. I know I'm very different with her than I have been with anyone else in the past, and I really like who I am with her. The 'feels' are strong with this one. Man, I like the digressions. Anyway, we were talking about why we don't go the moon anymore right? I think. I'm confused now. 

No, you're probably not what your genitalia is, most likely. That's right. "Get it together, Chris, jeez." Oh, and you're probably not even straight. Or gay. You're most likely Bisexual. Everyone's probably bisexual. "Because it's not binary, it's a spectrum." You like women to some degree, and you like men to some degree. 

.

You know your bros whom you watch sports with on Sundays? Or play poker with on Wednesdays? Yeah, that's all sexual. Hate to break it to you, but you're making sweet, sweet love. "Oh, so good." You love your bros, and they love the fuck out of you, you're about to bone, I bet you've played "gay chicken." There's a reason you play that. There's a reason that's a thing. People are attracted to danger. And having sex with your best friend is very dangerous. You are actually aroused in that moment. It is sexual. You know how you laugh the instant "gay chicken" ends? Do you feel your heart pumping as his lips come closer to yours? Do you feel that rush when you have sex with your girlfriend? If you don't, that's odd. Maybe you don't like your girlfriend. Maybe you're just trained to like women, so you hunt women, and put them down, and think that's "natural" and do all this other "extracurricular" stuff with men that feels so much better than listening to your stupid girlfriend talk about her stupid 'feelings' and crap. God she's annoying af. Let's just play poker, where it makes sense. 

.

Are you a woman who likes her girlfriend? Do you use a strap on? I won't even go there. Maybe you don't, maybe you just like fingers, and mouths. But you know men have fingers.... and mouths, right? But you want a vagina. Oh right, so it's all about what you personally want, I forgot. Maybe you should tell your girlfriend you're literally only with her as a person because she possesses a physical vagina. That's it. Otherwise you could get what you need from a man and a toy, or another woman, if the vagina fit you better.

.

Are you a gay man? (I'm doing everyone.) Why don't you date a trans man who uses a strap on? If you're a top, why don't you just date a woman and have anal sex, it's precisely the same thing, and you don't necessarily have anything to do with dick to be a gay guy, just ass. (The reverse is also possible). There are tons of straight men who absolutely love anal sex with women, I personally don't get the appeal, at all. I could literally take it or leave it. The vageen is perfectly fine for me, and if I'm willing to have anal sex with a woman, I'm about half a step away from having anal sex with a man. There's hardly a difference, I bet. But back to this, why doesn't this gay man date a progressive straight woman who uses a strap on. Actually, you, the gay man, don't have to be gay at all, you could be a straight man who just likes to 'peg.' I know it's confusing. And it's ok. :)

.

This is not really an indictment. This is a positive, affirmative challenge to the LGBTQ and straight communities to get your heads out of your asses, and out of your dicks, and out of your vaginas, and out of your eyes entirely, and into your 'ear holes.' "Family Guy" (remember this one?) was making FUN OF YOU, motherfucker. They were telling you to listen to each other. Get into your personalities instead. Stop "fucking" and start 'making love,' you can do it at Costco. You can figuratively get off in front of other people buying a toaster. I've done it and I've seen it.

So, get out of your genitalia and into the fact that the 'person' you meet (ignore everything else about them, their junk, their gender, their orientation, their race, their political views, their hair cut, their clothing, and their explicit words) and actually listen to them. Take the time to find out if the person you're currently able to get coffee with at this very moment is more of a 'top' than a 'bottom,' or more of a bottom than a top. Period. That's all that matters. 

You know you like to get things for other people more than receive them, or have things brought to you rather than be told what to do, either is totally fine. So, you find someone who likes to ask for things more than they like to get them for you or do things for you rather than ask for things, respectively. Instant match.

.

It's hard, I know.  When it comes to finding this out about people, there are problems. One, people lie, mostly. Especially men. Every man wants to be a top. It's not his fault. It's just in the societal training. Women lie too, they act sometimes like they want to be bottoms, when they don't. This is called, in BDSM, "doming from the bottom." There are two other problems. About what their preference is, people sometimes don't even know, themselves. And, most importantly, people don't even know themselves.

Now, if you're woke, which for the purposes of this paragraph is fortunate, because very few of you are. It's especially hard. Because you're sitting across from someone listening to them talk about their poker game last Wednesday, and just thinking to yourself about the train wreck you're witnessing that you sort of can't take your eyes off of, and all the texts you're composing in your head to your friends while they talk about the river turning and someone losing twenty bucks at their dime game, and playing this rad game of "gay chicken" (Chad and Dave are fucking hilarious, "totally, haha, check please"), and all you want to do is shake them like a baby. But you know it wouldn't do any good, because you're woke, and you know they aren't, so they wouldn't hear you. It's a paraphrase, but "you literally couldn't explain 'The Matrix' to someone, you have to show them." But it turns out you can't even show them, because everyone on the planet physically saw the movie called "The Matrix," and still not very many people get it. They just have to figure it out for themselves. I know it took me a hell of a long time. And I still might not be fully there, I can literally never know... Neiher can you, about you, ya nimrod. But you can about me. And I can about you. Perspective is a real bitch.

.

There's obviously another problem. Two "straight" women in a sexual relationship together is fairly doable, logistically. But what about two "straight" men? How do you handle that? How does anal sex enter the mind of a man that otherwise has never considered it? Well that's easy. Some men just aren't bottoms, but some men are. There are plenty of men I hear about from my women friends who ask these women to peg them in a heterosexual scenario. With a toy. These men are bottoms. Literally. They are half a step away from being "gay" but they can't accept in their own heads, probably, the concept of literally being in a relationship with a "man." So, they get with a masculine (or feminine--key word, 'willing') "woman" and ask her to use a toy on them. So, it still works out. If you're a man who doesn't like to receive anal sex, I'm not saying you should start, by any stretch of the imagination. Not at all. What I'm saying is that if you're a straight man who likes to 'peg.' You should start matching with men on Tinder and go to Columbia for your cocaine, instead of getting it cut on the street, because that's just plain dangerous. In the bad way, not the good way. Not literally, I'm trying to make a point. Actually, getting with men instead of women would be dangerous in the good way. If you are a straight man, who finds a match with a woman and it's working, and you like to bottom, by all means, ask her if she's willing to do that. Have a ball. But make it about the personality, first, not about her lack of a penis. Because, man, I don't know by preference or experience, but I'm just going to venture a guess that you're missing out on something when you don't go to a man for that.

And then the only remaining problem is getting otherwise straight men to be in consensual relationships with other men with whom it's a healthy relationship and who is otherwise a consensual bottom who would otherwise peg with a straight woman. Am I missing something? Obviously, sex is screwed up, obviously, we are unhealthy, obviously we are looking for things in the wrong places. Give me a goddamn break. Women don't want to be doing this. It's not their job.

We used to do this fine, then someone got super lazy, lazier than we already were, but it was inevitable, they used their big tool brain and spread some seeds on the ground and was like, "look you don't have to go hunting anymore, I have 'food right here....'," evolution is a bitch, and then we invented people that don't exist and the whole world literally built itself and fell apart at the exact same time. You're figuratively living in shit and you don't even know it. You refuse to know it.

.

But that's not the end of the story, we're not even through the second act yet. Not even half way. 

The way I want to end this piece is on a very positive note, because there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But we've just entered it, for god sake. The tunnel, not the light, there's still a lot of darkness around us. That will essentially never go away, it will just be different darkness. It's not even the first tunnel. There have been several. Ancient Egypt, Rome, and The Renaissance were just a few. A handful, in ten thousand years. And here I thought humans were "inteligente" or something. So, there's this small speck of light way off in the distance. Actually, it's around a bend, or a few, so we can't even really see it, and there are obviously forks in this tunnel, and they all lead to different exits, but I promise you it's there. I want you to take from this piece, two simple facts: 

Whatever your consensual, legal, sexual preferences are, they are ok. They are good, and you should pursue them with your whole honest heart. I can't and won't speak to anything else, not right now.

Also, this, and this is absolute, probably the only one beyond death, but in an perfectly balanced, entirely abstract way, opposite from the cold certainty of death. Probably the most abstract thing possible, this is called 'life': you don't have to follow any predefined pathway dictated by your biology about how to live your life. 

.

Your personality, which changes many times throughout your life, is literally the most important thing to you than anything else you possess in the entire world, including your home, your car, your phone, your partner, and your kids. So, do it some justice, and make it the most important thing when choosing the second most important thing in your life: your partner, or partners. Or your relationships in general. Because your personality should be dictating the dynamic of all your relationships either big or small, from your kids, to your parents, to your whole family, to your boss, to the cashier at Starbucks, in that instant, to your employees, to the acquaintances you hate, to your bros that you don't kiss, to your girlfriends that you maybe kiss, all the way to your best friend slash significant other.
