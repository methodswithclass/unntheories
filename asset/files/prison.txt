My three walled prison is where you are too. But you don't see it.

I see the walls and can imagine the sky above and the ground below this concrete floor. The possibility of what is outside this institution teases my mind and laughs at me. There are no rules in the prison for the inmates behavior, there are no guards keeping order.

The guards people see keeping order are imprisoned here too and hope to gain an advantage by masking themselves as guards when they are just inmates too. This prison has layers of cell upon cell and many people are inside smaller and smaller cells with many more walls between them and the open air.

I find myself now walking the corridors invisibly, the guards do not see me because I acknowledge the Â authority they declare and the other inmates are afraid of me because I am not in a cell.

For them the cell is right, the cell is comforting, the cell is their world. I want to break free of the prison. I want to see the outside world, but that is impossible.

All I can do is look for others who walk the corridors with me.

I am alone.

And that is my prison.

.

You are here outside your cell with me. We are in the corridors now, together, and as free as we can be.

We wander the facility together and observe those still locked in their cells, uninterested in escaping the cell of their own making.  Unable to.

We wander freely throughout the whole of the prison, seeing trapped people everywhere we go. We pity them.

We talk of the days in our cells and what it meant to escape. We dance and laugh and sing. We are happy.

Then I see it. The shadow on the wall. It's dancing and laughing and singing, but there's no one here. The light in my cell is flickering and dancing shadows on the walls. I have not left my cell, I am not in the corridors except those I have created in the comfort of this small space.

We can never escape, not even our cells.

And that is The Prison.
